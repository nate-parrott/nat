In UI code, use things like onReceive or WithSnapshotMain to observe the document store reactively, rather than just viewing the document storeâ€™s model once.

Tools for the main agent are registered in ChatView.swift

When calling external processes, make sure to read the file data BEFORE calling waitUntilExit:

        let process = Process()
        process.executableURL = URL(fileURLWithPath: "/usr/bin/git")
        process.arguments = ["ls-files", "--cached", "--others", "--exclude-standard"]
        process.currentDirectoryURL = url
        
        let pipe = Pipe()
        process.standardOutput = pipe

        do {
            try process.run()
            guard let data = try pipe.fileHandleForReading.readToEnd() else {
                throw FileTreeError.noData
            }
            process.waitUntilExit()
